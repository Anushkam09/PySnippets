## Problem Statement
You are given two cities, `A` and `B`, and a list of people, where each person has a cost associated with flying to either city. Your goal is to find the optimal way to send `N` people to city `A` and `N` people to city `B` such that the total cost is minimized.

The input consists of an array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost, bCost]`, which represents the cost of flying the `i-th` person to city `A` and city `B`. 

### Objective
- Return the minimum total cost to send `N` people to each city.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[50,30],[200,500]]
Output: 370
```


### Constraints
- `2 * n == costs.length`
- `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
- `costs.length` is even.
- `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

## Solution
This solution employs a dynamic programming approach to solve the Two City Scheduling problem.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

**DP Array Initialization:**

We initialize a 3D DP array `dp[i][wA][wB]`, where:
- `i` represents the first `i` people considered.
- `wA` represents the number of people sent to city `A`.
- `wB` represents the number of people sent to city `B`.

**Base Case:**

For `0` people, the total cost is `0` (no one is sent).

**Transition:**

For each person, we can choose to send them to either city `A` or city `B`, updating our DP table accordingly:
- If a person is sent to city `A`, we reduce the count of people going to city `A` and add the cost of sending them there.
- Similarly, if sent to city `B`, we reduce the count of people going to city `B` and add the respective cost.

**Final Calculation:**

The minimum total cost will be found in `dp[2 * N][N][N]`.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N³), where N is half the size of the costs array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N³) due to the 3D DP array.

### Code Implementation

Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(costs) // 2
        dp = [[[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)] for _ in range(2 * N + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, 2 * N + 1):
            for wA in range(1, N + 1):
                if dp[i - 1][wA - 1][0] == float('inf'):
                    dp[i][wA][0] = float('inf')
                else:
                    dp[i][wA][0] = costs[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][wA - 1][0]

            for wB in range(1, N + 1):
                if dp[i - 1][0][wB - 1] == float('inf'):
                    dp[i][0][wB] = float('inf')
                else:
                    dp[i][0][wB] = costs[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][0][wB - 1]
            
            dp[i][0][0] = float('inf')

        for i in range(1, 2 * N + 1):
            for wA in range(1, N + 1):
                for wB in range(1, N + 1):
                    if dp[i - 1][wA - 1][wB] == float('inf'):
                        dp[i][wA][wB] = costs[i - 1][1]
                    elif dp[i - 1][wA][wB - 1] == float('inf'):
                        dp[i][wA][wB] = costs[i - 1][0]
                    else:
                        dp[i][wA][wB] = min(costs[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][wA - 1][wB],
                                            costs[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][wA][wB - 1])

        return dp[2 * N][N][N]
```

### Conclusion
This solution effectively utilizes dynamic programming to optimize the process of scheduling flights to two cities, significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to a brute-force approach. By leveraging a 3D DP array, we ensure that we only compute each state once, leading to an efficient solution.
