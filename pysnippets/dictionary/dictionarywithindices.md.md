# Convert List to a Dictionary with Indices

## Overview

This project provides a function to convert a list into a dictionary, where each list element maps to its index. This is useful in cases where you need to map unique items in a list to their respective positions.

## Files

- **dictionarywithindices.py**: Contains the `convert_list_to_dict_with_indices` function, which performs the list-to-dictionary conversion.

- **test_dictionarywithindices.py**: Contains unit tests for `convert_list_to_dict_with_indices`, verifying the correct functionality of the conversion.

## Example

Given a list like `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the function will return `{'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}`.

## How to Run Tests

To run the unit tests, execute:

```bash
python -m unittest test_dictionarywithindices.py
```

This will validate that the function works correctly.
